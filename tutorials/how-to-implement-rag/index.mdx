   title: How to implement RAG with managed inference
   description:
---

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful approach for enhancing a model's knowledge by leveraging your own dataset.
Scaleway's robust infrastructure makes it easier than ever to implement RAG, as our products are fully compatible with LangChain, especially the OpenAI integration.
By utilizing our managed inference services, managed databases, and object storage, you can effortlessly build and deploy a customized model tailored to your specific needs.

<Macro id="requirements" />
- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- [Inference Deployment](/ai-data/managed-inference/how-to/create-deployment/): Set up an inference deployment using [sentence-transformers/sentence-t5-xxl](/ai-data/managed-inference/reference-content/sentence-t5-xxl/) on an L4 instance to efficiently process embeddings.
- [Inference Deployment](/ai-data/managed-inference/how-to/create-deployment/) with the model of your choice.
- [Object Storage Bucket](/storage/object/how-to/create-a-bucket/) to store all the data you want to inject into your LLM model.
- [Managed Database](/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/create-a-database/) to securely store all your embeddings.
