In this tutorial, you'll explore two powerful tools, HashiCorp Terraform and Ansible, to set up and manage your Apple Silicon server. By automating infrastructure deployment and configuration, you can save time and reduce manual errors.

<Macro id="requirements" />

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) status or [IAM permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission) allowing you to perform actions in the intended Organization
- A valid [API key](/identity-and-access-management/iam/how-to/create-api-keys/)

## Understanding the Tools

### HashiCorp Terraform
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision your infrastructure as code (IaC). It enables you to create reproducible environments and manage your infrastructure through versioned configuration files.

### Ansible
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an automation tool that uses playbooks to manage configurations and deploy applications. It helps maintain a clean and efficient directory structure, making automation tasks more manageable.

## How to create an apple-silicon server

### Using Terraform

1. Download and install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

2. Create a Directory: First, create a directory for your Terraform project. Open your terminal and run:

```shell
mkdir apple_silicon_server_terraform
cd apple_silicon_server_terraform
```

3. Create a Terraform Configuration File: Inside this directory, create a file named resources.tf:

```shell
touch resources.tf
```

4. Define the Required Providers: Open resources.tf in your preferred text editor and add the following code to specify the Scaleway provider and the required Terraform version:

```shell
terraform {
  required_providers {
    scaleway = {
      source = "scaleway/scaleway"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">=0.13"
}

```

5. Define the Apple Silicon Server: In the same resources.tf file, add the configuration to create your Apple Silicon server:

```terraform
#resources.tf
resource "scaleway_apple_silicon_server" "server" {
    name = "test-m2"
    type = "M2-M"
    zone = "fr-par-1"
}
```

6. Apply the Configuration: To apply this configuration, run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
#Initialize Terraform
terraform init
#Plan the deployment
terraform plan
#Create the server
terraform apply
```

When prompted, type yes to confirm the creation of the resources.

### Using Ansible

1. Install Ansible: You can install Ansible using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command:

```shell
pip install ansible
```

2. Install Scaleway Ansible Collection: Run the following command to install the Scaleway collection for Ansible:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install scaleway.scaleway
```

3. Create a Directory: First, create a directory for your Ansible project. Open your terminal and run:

```shell
mkdir apple_silicon_server_ansible
cd apple_silicon_server_ansible
```

4. Create a Playbook: Create a new file named create_applesilicon_server.yml:

```shell
touch create_applesilicon_server.yml
```

5. Define the Playbook Content: Open create_applesilicon_server.yml in your text editor and add the following content:

```ansible
---
- name: Create Apple Silicon Server on Scaleway
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Create an Apple Silicon server
      scaleway.scaleway.scaleway_applesilicon_server:
        access_key: "{{ scw_access_key }}"
        secret_key: "{{ scw_secret_key }}"
        state: present
        type_: "M2-M"  # Replace with your desired server type
        name: "my-applesilicon-server"  # Optional: specify a name for your server
        zone: "fr-par-1"  # Optional: specify the zone if needed
        project_id: "your_project_id"  # Optional: specify the project ID
      register: applesilicon_server

    - name: Output server information
      debug:
        var: applesilicon_server
```

6. Ensure to replace your_project_id with your actual project ID if applicable.

7. Replace Placeholders: Ensure to replace your_project_id with your actual project ID if applicable.

```shell
ansible-playbook create_applesilicon_server.yml -e "scw_access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY scw_secret_key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```
Replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY and YOUR_SECRET_KEY with your actual Scaleway credentials.

8. Check the Output: The playbook will output the details of the created server, including its ID, IP address, status, and other relevant information.

## How to read server info

### Using Terraform

To read server information after creation, you can use the terraform output command, assuming you have defined output variables in your resources.tf. For example:

```terraform
#resources.tf
output "server_ip" {
  value = scaleway_apple_silicon_server.server.ip
}
```

After applying the configuration, run:

```shell
terraform output server_ip
```
