This document sets out guidance, advice and best practices for building and optimizing your Scaleway VPCs and Private Networks.

## What are Private Networks and VPCs?

VPC allows you to build your own **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud on top of Scaleway's shared public cloud. Within each VPC, you can create **Private Networks**. Resources attached to Private Networks can communicate securely between themselves, away from the public internet, reducing security risks by ensuring traffic is isolated from public routes.

The VPC operates at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model, while Private Networks are a layer 2 resource. As such, a VPC is responsible for routing packets between its different Private Networks. The [**VPC Routing**](TODO) feature auto-creates managed routes between the Private Networks of a VPC, so resources on different Private Networks within a VPC can communicate. You can also use [InterLink](TODO) to connect your VPC to your own on-premises infrastructure. Meanwhile, Private Networks provide network isolation within a VPC and enable you to segment your resources and traffic across different subnets.

The OSI model shows how different protocols work together and communicate in a networked environment. Scaleway VPC sits at level 3, and Scaleway Private Networks site at level 2." />

VPCs and Private Networks are both **regional** resources. When you create a Private Network in a VPC, it is necessarily scoped to the same region as the VPC. Some Scaleway resources are also regional, others are zonal and scoped to a single Availability Zone (AZ). When attaching resources to a Private Network, you can attach resources from any AZ within the Private Network's region, allowing for example an Elastic Metal server in PAR-2 to communicate securely, away from the public internet, with an Instance in PAR-1 and a Managed Database in PAR-3.

| Region                  | Availability Zones        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| France - Paris          | PAR1, PAR2, PAR3          | 
| Netherlands - Amsterdam | AMS1, AMS2, AMS3          |
| Poland - Warsaw         | WAW1, WAW2, WAW3          |

One default VPC for each region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project).

## Designing your network topology

When you start creating resources and building your infrastructure with Scaleway, take some time to consider and plan your network topology. We recommend that you build your VPC infrastructure with **separation of concerns** in mind. Separation of concerns is a fundamental design principle aimed at breaking down large complex systems into smaller, distinct components each with clear responsibilities and interfaces. This kind of design will future-proof your VPC and come into its own when Scaleway introduces features such as custom routing and ACLs.

 Separating resources into different Private Networks according to function and usage can:
- Improve network performance by reducing broadcast traffic and congestion
- Enhance manageability via a logical organization of resources
- Enable easier troubleshooting, monitoring and maintenance
- Allow for easier scalability

For example, you may use one Private Network for frontend resources and another for backend resources, limiting public access only via Load Balancers and/or Public Gateways, stripping other resources of public IP addresses. You may want to create different VPCs for production and test environments, allowing you isolate potential errors in testing from the production environment.

## Creating Private Networks

- Subnetting

## Attaching resources to Private Networks

- Using IPAM to reserve and assign IPs
- Considering whether public IP is necessary

## Connecting your Private Networks

- Public Gateways
- Load Balancers
- VPC Routing
- VPC Peering

For secure, dedicated connectivity between resources in a Scaleway VPC and your on-premises architecture, consider creating an [InterLink](TODO). Otherwise, you may consider installing a manual VPN on a Scaleway Instance to connect to other non-Scaleway infrastructure, and create a [custom route](TODO) towards this VPN so traffic on your Private Network can securely communicate with resources at the other end of your VPN tunnel. 

## Security best practices

- Security groups and network ACLs
- Monitoring and logging (Utilizing cloud provider tools for network traffic analysis and security auditing.)
- Apply the principals of zero trust networking

## Cost management
- Understand pricing
- Avoid common pitfalls that can lead to unexpected charges via cost optimization
