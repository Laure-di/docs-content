This document sets out guidance, advice and best practices for building and optimizing your Scaleway VPCs and Private Networks.

## What are Private Networks and VPCs?

## Designing your network topology

- Separation of concerns, separate different tiers (e.g. web, application, database)
- Regions and zones

We recommend that you build your VPC infrastructure with **separation of concerns** in mind. Separation of concerns is a fundamental design principle aimed at breaking down large complex systems into smaller, distinct components each with clear responsibilities and interfaces. This kind of design will future-proof your VPC and come into its own when we introduce features such as custom routing and ACLs.

 Separating resources into different Private Networks according to function and usage can:
- Improve network performance by reducing broadcast traffic and congestion
- Enhance manageability via a logical organization of resources
- Enable easier troubleshooting, monitoring and maintenance
- Allow for easier scalability

For example, you may use one Private Network for frontend resources and another for backend resources, limiting public access only via Load Balancers and/or Public Gateways.

## Creating a Private Network

- Subnetting

## Attaching resources to Private Networks

- Using IPAM to reserve and assign IPs
- Considering whether public IP is necessary

## Connecting your Private Networks

- Public Gateways
- Load Balancers
- VPC Routing
- VPC Peering

## Security best practices

- Security groups and network ACLs
- Monitoring and logging (Utilizing cloud provider tools for network traffic analysis and security auditing.)
- Apply the principals of zero trust networking

## Cost management
- Understand pricing
- Avoid common pitfalls that can lead to unexpected charges via cost optimization

## Use cases
